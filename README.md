##Overview
Hoping to start a Surf and Ice Cream shop in Oahu, W. Avy is looking for more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

##Results
Hawaii is known for its consistent temps throughout the year and the statistics above show that there is only slight variation from June to December regarding temps.

--The average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees, while in December it is 71.0. Slightly cooler in December but still reasonable for outdoor recreation and dining.
--Looking at the minimum temperature for these months we do see that it can reach temperatures in both months that are likely cooler than ideal for a surf and ice cream shop (64 degrees in June and 56 degrees in December). However, we can see from the data that only a quarter of the temps measured were 69 degrees or lower in December, and in June this lowest quarter were between 64 and 73 degrees. Those minimum temperatures are likely in the middle of the night as well. Not exactly the time to go out for ice cream.
--The maximum temperatures for both months are consistent with the rest of the year and only a couple of degrees different (June max temp is 85 degrees, December max temp is 83 degrees).

##Summary
The results show that Oahu has near ideal temperatures in June and December for a surf and ice cream shop. However, there are other factors that could affect the success of the business.

Additional queries that need to be reviewed have to look at the precipitation amounts for these two months. Wind speed plays a factor as well, but that data is not provided in the database we used for the temperature query.

Using the data we have, it would be worthwhile to look at temperature and precipitation grouped by time of day. If we assume the majority of our surfing business would be during daylight, and ice cream sales would likely be in afternoon; the data by time of day would be useful.
